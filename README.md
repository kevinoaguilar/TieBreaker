**About the Project**
TieBreaker is a web-based decision-making platform designed to help two or more people quickly decide what to eat, what to watch, or what activity to do, without the need for anoy debates or indecision.
The application acts as a neutral third party that produces recommendations based off the host's locations of the session. As users login to the application, it gathers further preferences based on previous decisions. TieBreaker is built to reduce decision fatigue and make group planning faster, simpler, and more enjoyable.

**Problem Statement**
Group decisions often break down because:

  People have different preferences

  No one wants to make the final call

  Conversations loop without resolution
  

TieBreaker solves this problem by structuring the decision process and applying consistent logic to reach a clear result everyone can move forward with.


**Core Features**
👥 Multi-user sessions for group decisions

🍔 Food selection based on shared preferences

🎬 Movie/show selection based on genres and availability

🎉 Activity selection based on interests and constraints

⚖️ Tie-breaking logic to resolve conflicting inputs

🔗 Session-based workflow using shared links or codes


**How TieBreaker Works**

Create a Session
A user selects a decision type: Food, Movie/Show, or Activity.

Join the Session
Other participants join using a session link or code.

Submit Preferences
Each participant inputs their preferences (genres, cuisines, activity types, etc.).

Decision Processing
The system filters and evaluates all inputs using decision logic designed to be fair and unbiased.

Final Result
TieBreaker presents a single outcome—the final decision.
