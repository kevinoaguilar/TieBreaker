# TieBreaker

**TieBreaker** is a web-based decision-making platform designed to help two or more people quickly decide what to eat, what to watch, or what activity to do, without the need for annoying debates or indecision.

The application acts as a neutral third party that produces recommendations based on the host's location. As users log in to the application, it gathers further preferences based on previous decisions. TieBreaker is built to reduce decision fatigue and make group planning faster, simpler, and more enjoyable.

## Problem Statement

Group decisions often break down because:
* People have different preferences.
* No one wants to make the final call.
* Plans that never make it out of the group chat

TieBreaker solves this problem by structuring the decision process and applying logic to reach a clear result that everyone can agree on.

## Core Features

* **Multi-user Sessions:** Simplifies group decisions in real-time with multiple users.
* **Food Selection:** Generates dining options based on shared preferences/locations.
* **Entertainment Selection:** Suggests movies or shows based on genres and availability.
* **Activity Selection:** Recommends activities based on interests and location.
* **Tie-breaking Logic:** Resolves conflicting inputs fairly.
* **Session Workflow:** Uses shared links or codes for easy access.

## How TieBreaker Works

1.  **Create a Session:** A user selects a decision type: Food, Movie/Show, or Activity.
2.  **Join the Session:** Other participants join using a session through link or code.
3.  **Submit Preferences:** Each participant inputs their preferences (genres, cuisines, activity types, etc.).
4.  **Decision Processing:** The system filters and evaluates all inputs using decision logic designed to be fair and unbiased.
5.  **Final Result:** TieBreaker presents a single outcome, a final decision.
